## STM32 Microcontroller

This repository contains the assignments for the Academic Courses "Microcontrollers and Peripherals" taught in the Spring of 2019-2020 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The purpose of this laboratory series is the familiarization with **Nucleo STM32F401RE** produced by **ARM**, These series of projects aim at the deeper understanding of the programming of Microcontrollers and their integration in an Embedding System with peripherals, such as LEDs, LCD screens, Temperature/Humidity and Distance Sensors.

The programming environment used for the development of these projects was **Keil uVision** with its tools **CMSIS Core and Device Startup**. Moreover the executable files were produced with the help of **ARM Compiler 5 and ST-Link Debugger**. The programming concerns combined compilation of **C programming** source code along with **Assembly** files, possible due to the embedded assembler.

The results of every project are listed in the respective folders and are provided in the respective README.md files.
